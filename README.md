# Sims 4 Cache Deletion Batch File

I made this batch file for the people that are too lazy (I'm one of them) to navigate to the documents folder and delete the sims 4 caches.
Just double-click the file to run.

If you don't want to see the message pop up every time you run the script, then change the showMessages variable to 'false'.

In case the batch file doesn't work, try replacing the "%UserProfile%\Documents" part with the folder path to your documents folder.
(for example, my sims 4 documents folder is located in 'E:\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4'. The folderpath variable would then become "E:\Documents")
