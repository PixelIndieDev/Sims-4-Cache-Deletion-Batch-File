# Sims 4 Cache Deletion Batch File

I made this batch file for the people that are too lazy (I'm one of them) to navigate to the documents folder and delete the sims 4 caches.
Just double-click the file to run.

In case the batch file doesn't work, try replacing the '%UserProfile%\Documents' part with the folder path to your documents folder.
(for example, my documents folder is located in 'E:\Documents' the line would then become *DEL /q /F "E:\Documents\Electronic Arts\The Sims 4\localthumbcache.package"*)
